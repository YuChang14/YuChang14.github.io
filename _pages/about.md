<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I am working as an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm Intern at Baidu. My research focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and multimodal large language models (MLLM). 

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in Artificial Intelligence for the fall of 2024.</span> If you are looking for a passionate and self-driven Ph.D. candidate for research, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:chang812887117@gmail.com">chang812887117@gmail.com</a>.
